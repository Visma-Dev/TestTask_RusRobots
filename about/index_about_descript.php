<p>A novice Backend developer.</p>

<p>During (and for) training, I implemented a full-fledged news site - with registration and CRUD, a custom library for safe work with PDO, and small OOP projects, with the aim of more practice in this topic.</p>

<p>I have theoretical and practical knowledge in working with GIT and Composer, I know the basic PSR standards, I have experience working with Linux distributions. I also have a pretty good level of English, and do not have bad habits. I am currently actively studying the Laravel framework.</p>
